# A list of file glob-like patterns used to filter any files or directories that should not be included in the build
# artifact. A pattern is matched from the relative path of the file or directory of the collection directory. This
# uses 'fnmatch' to match the files or directories. Some directories and files like 'galaxy.yml', '*.pyc', '*.retry',
# and '.git' are always filtered
